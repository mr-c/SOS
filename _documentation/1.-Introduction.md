## Overview of SoS concepts

A SoS **script** defines one or more **workflows**, and each workflow consists of one or more **steps**. 

![workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/media/workflow.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Although the input and output can be more general, each step typically has its **input**, **output**, and **dependents** files, it executes a **step process** that consists of one or more Python statements and SoS actions (special python functions). Part or all the step process, called **tasks**, can be executed and monitored externally.

A SoS script contains **comments**, **statements**, and one or more SoS **steps**. A SoS **step** consists of a **header**
with one or more step names and optional options. The body of a SoS step consists of optional **comments**, 
**statements**, **input**, **output**, **depends** files, **parameter** definitions, followed by step **process**. The following figure 
shows a sample script that defines a workflow with two steps:

## Formal definitions of terminology & grammar

* **Script**: A SoS script that defines one or more workflows.
* **Workflow**: A sequence of processes that can be executed to complete certain task.
* **Step**: A step of a workflow that perform one piece of the workflow.
* **Target**: Objects that are input and result of a SoS step, which are usually files, but can also be objects such as an executable command (with variable locations), and a SoS variable.
* **Step options**: Options of the step that assist the definition of the workflow.
* **Step input**: Specifies the input files of the step.
* **Step output**: Specifies the output files and targets of the step.
* **Step dependencies**: Specifies the files and targets that are required by the step.
* **Step process**: The process that a step executes to complete specified work, specified as one or more Python statements. 
* **Task**: Part or all step process that will be executed and monitored outside of SoS. These are usually resource intensive jobs that will take long time to complete.
* **Action**: SoS or user-defined Python functions. They differ from regular Python functions in that they may behave differently in different running mode of SoS (e.g. ignore when executed in dryrun mode).


More formally defined, the SoS syntax obeys the following grammar, given in extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF):

```
Script         = {comment}, {statement}, {step};
comment        = "#", text, NEWLINE
assignment     = name, "=", expression, NEWLINE
```

with SoS steps defined as

```
step           = step_header,
                 {comment}, { {statement}, [input | output | depends ]},
                 [process, NEWLINE, {script} ]
step_header    = "[", section_names, [":", names | options], "]", NEWLINE
parameter      = "parameter", ":", assignment
input          = "input", ":", [expressions], [",", options], NEWLINE
output         = "output", ":", [expressions], [",", options], NEWLINE
depends        = "depends", ":", [expressions], [",", options], NEWLINE
task           = "task", ":",  [options]
action         = func_format | script_format
func_format    = name, "(", [options], ")"
script_format  = name, ":", [options], NEWLINE, script 
section_names  = section_name, ",", section_name
section_name   = name, "(", text, ")"
names          = name, {",", name}
workflow       = name, ['_', steps], {"+", name, ['_', steps}
assignment     = name, "=", expression, NEWLINW
expressions    = expression, {",", expression}
options        = option, {"," option}
option         = name, "=", expression
```

Here `name`, `expression` and `statement` are arbitrary [Python](http://www.python.org) names, expression and statements with added SoS features. **SoS requires Python 3 and does not support Python 2.x specific syntax**


This documentation is a comprehensive reference to all SoS features. Please refer to this [SoS quick start tutorial](https://github.com/BoPeng/SOS/wiki/1.-Quick-Start) to learn some basics of SoS before diving into the details.
