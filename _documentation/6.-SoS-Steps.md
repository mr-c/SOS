Although no item is required for a SoS step, a complete SoS step can have the following form

{% highlight sos %}
[step_name: option1, option2, ...]
#
# description of the step
#

statements
input:    input files, opt1=value1, opt2=value2

statements (executed in SoS)
output:	  output files, opt1=value1, opt2=value2

statements (executed in SoS)
depends:  dependent files, opt1=value1, opt2=value2

statements (executed in SoS)
task:  opt1=value1, opt2=value2 (executed outside of SoS)
statements or script 
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, a step can have `input`, `output`, `depends`, `task` keywords with their options, with arbitrary Python statements around them.

## Targets

Targets are objects that a SoS step can input, output, or dependent on. They are usually files that are presented by filenames, but can also be other targets.

### `executable` target

`executable` targets are commands that should be accessible and executable by SoS. These targets are usually listed in the `depends` section of a SoS step. For example, SoS would stop if a command `fastqc` is not found.

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input:     fastq_files
depends:   executable('fastqc')
sh:
    fastqc ${fastq_files}
{% endhighlight %}

`executable` target can also be output of a step but installing executables can be tricky because the commands should be installed to existing `$PATH` so that they can be immediately accessible by SoS. Because SoS automatically adds `~/.sos/bin` to `$PATH` (option `-b`), an environment-neutral way for on-the-fly installation is to install commands to this directory. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[10: provides=executable('fastqc')]
sh:
    # download fastqc
    # install fastqc
    # link fastqc to ~/.sos/bin
{% endhighlight %}

would be called if executable `fastqc` is not found.

### `sos_variable` target

`sos_variable(name)` targets represent SoS variables that are created by a SoS step and shared to other steps. These targets can be used to provide information to other steps. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[get_total_reads: shared='total_reads']
input:  'alignment/summary.txt'
with open(input[0]) as ifile:
    ...
    total_reads = int(...)


[100]
depends: sos_variable('total_reads')
output:  'report.txt'

with open(output[0]) as report:
    report.write('total reads: ${total_reads}')

{% endhighlight %}

Step `100` needed some information extracted from output of another step. You can either parse the information in step `100` or use another step to provide the information. The latter is recommended because the information could be requested by multiple steps.

### `env_variable` target

SoS keeps tract of runtime environment and creates signatures of executed steps so that they do not have to be executed again. Some commands, especially shell scripts, could however behave differently with different environmental variables. To make sure a step would be re-executed with changing environments, you should list these variables as dependencies of the step. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
depends:   env_variable('DEBUG')
sh:
    echo DEBUG is set to $DEBUG
{% endhighlight %}

### `dynamic` target

A `dynamic` target is a target that can only be determined when the step is actually executed. For example, the input of the following step would not be evaluated until step `20` is executed.

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
#
# a step that generate some text with dynamically determined names
#

[20]
input: dynamic('*.txt')

{% endhighlight %}

In this particular case, if you specify

{% highlight sos %}
[20]
input: '*.txt'

{% endhighlight %}

SoS would find all `.txt` files at the beginning of the execution of the workflow and feed them to step `20`.

## Step name and alias

A section can define one or more steps, with step names separated by comma. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[human_10, mouse_10]
{% endhighlight %}

defines a section with two steps for two different workflows. The step name can be followed by a numeric index, which indicates the relative position of the step in a workflow.

An alias, or description, is allowed for step name. Although the description does not affect the workflow and index of the step, it helps identify the step in the SoS output. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[human_10 (quality check)]
{% endhighlight %}

define a step with description `quality check`.

## Step options

**Step options** are specified after step name that assists the specification of workflows. SoS provides the following options

### Option `skip`

Option `skip` takes two formats, the first format has no value

{% highlight sos %}
[10: skip]
{% endhighlight %}

and is equivalent to

{% highlight sos %}
[10: skip=True]
{% endhighlight %}

The whole step will be skipped as if it is not defined at all in the script. This option provides a quick method to disable a step.

The second format takes a value, which is usually an expression that will be evaluated when the step is executed. For example, in the following workflow,

{% highlight sos %}
# tool suite to align the reads
parameter: quality_check = True

[10: skip= not quality_check]
{% endhighlight %}

Step 10 will be skipped if option `--quality_check no` is specified from command line.

### Option `sigil`

Because a SoS script can include scripts in different languages with different sigils (special characters used to enclose expression), **SoS allows the use of different sigils** in the script. Whereas the default sigil (`${ }`) has to be used for global variables, other sigils can be used for different sections of the script. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[step_10: sigil='%( )']
title = 'Sample %(sample_names[0]) results'
run:
	for file in *.fastq
	do
		echo Processing ${file} ...
		echo %(title)
	done
{% endhighlight %}

uses a different sigil style because the embedded shell script uses `${ }`. In this example `${file}` keeps its meaning in the shell script while `%(sample_names[0])` and `%(title)` are replaced by SoS to their values.

Option `sigil` accept only a constant string (not a variable or expression).

### Option `shared`

SoS executes each step in a separate process and by default does not return any result to the master SoS process. Option `shared` is used to share variables between steps. This option accepts:

* A string (variable name), or
* A map between variable names and expressions (strings) that will be evaluated upon the completion of the step.
* A sequence of strings (variables) or maps.

After the completion of a step, local variables defined in the `shared` option will be sent to the global environment so that later steps can use the updated value. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
parameter: trim = False
parameter: input_files = list

[10: shared={'input_files':'output'}, skip=trim is False]
input:  input_files, group_by=1
output: '${_input[0]}.trimmed'

sh:
    trim ${input} > ${output}

[20]
input: input_files
# do something
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `trim` is an option to trim input files defined in another parameter `input_files`. If `trim` is false, step 10 is ignored and step 20 handles `input_files`. If `trim` is True, the files are trimmed and produces `${_input[0]}.trimmed`. Variable `input_files` are sent back to the global environment so that step 20 would be handling the trimmed version of input files.

A map syntax is recommended to share `output` of one step with others, because the variable assignment will be evaluated only after the step is complete:
{% highlight sos %}
[1: shared = {'test_output': 'output'}]
...
[2]
input: test_output
{% endhighlight %}
The map syntax is evaluated as expressions; therefore it is possible to finer control what specific output, or variations of output, to share with others. For example:

{% highlight sos %}
[1: shared={'test_output_1':'output[0]', 'test_output_2': 'output[1]'}]
...
[2]
input: test_output_1
{% endhighlight %}

to shared the first file in `output` (filename `output[0]`) instead of the entire output file list.

NOTE: Because global variables are readonly, they cannot be changed by individual steps through the `shared` option. Shared variable therefore has to be either new variables or parameters.

### Option `provides`

This option lists files or targets a step generates so that it can be called if the target is required but does not exist. Please see section [auxiliary step](Format-Specification#auxiliary-workflow-steps-and-makefile-style-dependency-rules) for details. A step can be treated as both a forward step and an auxiliary step despite of the differences on how they are invoked.

## Step input

### Input files

The input of SoS step follows the following rules:

* **the input of a SoS step is by default the output of the previous step**, which is `None` for the first step.
* **`input` option**, which could be **a list** of filenames (string literal, variables, or expressions that return filenames).  Wildcard characters (`*`, which matches everything and `?`, which matches any single character) are acceptable. Nested lists are flattened.

Examples of input specification are as follows:

{% highlight sos %}
input: []

input: 'file1.fasta', 'file2.fasta'

input: 'file*.fasta', 'filename with space.fasta'

input:
    'file*.txt',
    'directory/file2.txt'

input: aligned_reads

input: aligned_reads, reference_genome

input: aligned_reads[2:]

input: 'data/*.fastq'

input: '*/GXT*.fastq'

input: func(parameter)
{% endhighlight %}

It is worth noting that

* The first examples shows that the step does not need any input file (so it does not depend on any other step).
* It does not matter if `aligned_reads` and `reference_genome` are strings or lists of strings because SoS will flatten nested lists to a single list of filenames.
* The `input` option tries to expand filenames with wildcard characters (`*` and `?`). This can be very useful for workflows that, for example, regularly scan a directory and process unprocessed files. However, because the value of this step depends on availability of files, the output of `sos show script` and the execution path will be unpredictable, and even wrong if there is no available file during the execution of `sos show script`.

The input files will be evaluated and form a list of input files. They are by default sent to the step process all at once as varible `_input`, but can also be sent in groups, each time
with different `_input`. Here `_input` is a temporary variable that is available only within the step.

### Option `filetype`

SoS allows the specification of input options, which are appended to input file list as comma separated `name=value` pairs.

Option `filetype` accepts one or more filetypes or a lambda function. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:
	input_files, filetype='*.fastq'
{% endhighlight %}

passes only files with extension `*.fastq`.

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:
	input_files,
	filetype=['*.fastq', '*.fastq.gz']

{% endhighlight %}

passes only files with extension `.fastq` or `.fastq.gz`. Under the hood SoS treats the pattern as Unix shell-stype wildcard pattern (with `*`, `?`, `[seq]` and `[!seq]`, see [doc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html#module-fnmatch) for details) so

* **`filetype='.txt'` does not match `file.txt`**
* `filetype='*.fastq*'` matches `a.fastq`, `a.fastq.gz` and `a.fastq.zip`
* `filetype='[!_]*.txt'` matches `file1.txt` but not `_file1.txt`

If you need more refined control over the selection of files, you can use lambda functions (a bit python knowledge is required). For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:
	input_files,
	filetype=lambda x: open(x).readline().startswith('##fileformat=VCF4.1')
{% endhighlight %}

passes only files with the first line starting with string `##fileformat=VCF4.1``.


### Option `group_by`

SoS by default passes all input files to step process as a single list. Option `group_by` pass input files in groups, each time with a subset of input files named `_input`. SoS allows you to group input by `single` (individual file), `pairs` (match first half of files with the second half),  `combinations` (all unordered combinations of 2-sets), `pairwise` (all adjacent 2-sets), or chunks of size `N` (integer `group_by=3` or string `group_by='4'`). For example, with the following sos script

{% highlight sos %}
# how to group input files
parameter: group = 'all'

[0]
print('group_by=${group}')
input: 'file1', 'file2', 'file3', 'file4', group_by=group
print('${_index}: ${_input}')
{% endhighlight %}

The output of commands are

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos  -i -v0
group_by=all
0: file1 file2 file3 file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 'single' -i -v0
group_by=single
0: file1
1: file2
2: file3
3: file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 'pairwise' -i -v0
group_by=pairwise
0: file1 file2
1: file2 file3
2: file3 file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 'pairs' -i -v0
group_by=pairs
0: file1 file3
1: file2 file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 'combinations' -i -v0
group_by=combinations
0: file1 file2
1: file1 file3
2: file1 file4
3: file2 file3
4: file2 file4
5: file3 file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 1 -i -v0
group_by=1
0: file1
1: file2
2: file3
3: file4

$ sos run test.sos --group 2 -i -v0
group_by=2
0: file1 file2
1: file3 file4
{% endhighlight %}
Here we are running the script in inspect mode to avoid "file not found" errors for input files.

Obviously, the output of the `pairs` cases depends on the order of files. If you need to pair files in any particular order, you can control it in input. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:
	sorted([x for x in fastq_files if '_R1_' in x]),
	sorted([x for x in fastq_files if '_R2_' in x]),
	group_by='pairs'

run('echo ${input}')
{% endhighlight %}

will take all input files and sort them by `_R1_` and `_R2_` and by filename, and pair them.

### Option `for_each`

Option `for_each` allows you to repeat step process for each value of a variable. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
method = ['m1', 'm2']
input: 'file1', 'file2', for_each='method'
print('${_index}: ${_input} ${_method}')
{% endhighlight %}

will repeat the step with each item of variable `method`

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos -v0
0: file1 file2 m1
1: file1 file2 m2
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the SoS automatically creates a loop variable `_method` for variable `method`. If the variable is an attribute of an object (e.g. `aligned.output`), the iterator variable will be named without the attribute part.

Nested loops are also allowed. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
method = ['m1', 'm2']
pars = [1, 2]
input: 'file1', 'file2', for_each=['method', 'pars']
print('${_index}: _input=${_input} _method=${_method}, _pars=${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

would produce

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos -v0
0: _input=file1 file2 _method=m1, _pars=1
1: _input=file1 file2 _method=m2, _pars=1
2: _input=file1 file2 _method=m1, _pars=2
3: _input=file1 file2 _method=m2, _pars=2
{% endhighlight %}

If you would like to loop the process with several parameters, you can put them into the same level by 'var1,var2'. For example,


{% highlight sos %}
[0]
method = ['m1', 'm2']
pars = [1, 2]
input: 'file1', 'file2', for_each='method,pars'
print('${_index}: _input=${_input} _method=${_method}, _pars=${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

would produce

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos -v0
0: _input=file1 file2 _method=m1, _pars=1
1: _input=file1 file2 _method=m2, _pars=2
{% endhighlight %}

The variable passed to option `for_each` can a sequence, or a Pandas dataframe. In this case, each `_loop` variable presents a line in the dataframe and you can access single values using format `_loop["header"]`. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame([(1, 2, 'Hello'), (2, 4, 'World')], columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
input: for_each='data'
output: '${_data["A"]}_${_data["B"]}_${_data["C"]}.txt'
sh:
    touch ${_output}
{% endhighlight %}

would produce results with names `1_2_Hello.txt` and `2_4_World.txt`.

### Option `paired_with`

Input files might might come with additional information such as sample type, and sample name, and you can pair these information to input files using the `paired_with` option. For example, `bam_files` in the following example have matched `mutated` and `sample_name`, you can atteched these information to groups of input files `_input` with looped paired with variables.

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
bam_files = ['case/A1.bam', 'case/A2.bam', 'ctrl/A1.bam', 'ctrl/A2.bam']
mutated = ['case', 'case', 'ctrl', 'ctrl']
sample_name = ['A1', 'A2', 'A1', 'A2']

input: bam_files, paired_with=['mutated', 'sample_name'], group_by='pairs'

print('${_index}: _input=${_input} _mutated=${_mutated}, _sample_name=${_sample_name}')
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos -v0
0: _input=case/A1.bam ctrl/A1.bam _mutated=case ctrl, _sample_name=A1 A1
1: _input=case/A2.bam ctrl/A2.bam _mutated=case ctrl, _sample_name=A2 A2
{% endhighlight %}

Similar to option `for_each`, if the variable is an attribute of an object (e.g. `aligned.output`), the iterator variable will be named without the attribute part (e.g. `_aligned` for `paired_with='aligned.output'`).

### Option `pattern`

This option does the reverse of function `expand_pattern`. It uses named wildcards to match pattern to all input files, and creates step variables for these wildcard objects. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:  'a-20.txt', 'b-10.txt', pattern = '{name}-{par}.txt'
output: expand_pattern('{name}-processed-{par}.txt')
run('echo ${output}; touch ${output}')
{% endhighlight %}

will take all input files and extract `name` and `par` from each file name as variables `name` and `par`. It is then used to create output file names adding the word `processed` in between these wildcard objects. The outcome of the SoS script above is creation of files `a-processed-10.txt` and `b-processed-20.txt`.

When wildcard objects are accessed as step variables, both variable names with and without `_` prefix is available, e.g. in this example, both `_name` and `name`, `_par` and `par` are avaiable and are the same. The two conventions will only differ when [`group_by`](Documentation#option-group_by) or ['for_each'](Documentation#option-for_each) is also used.

{% highlight sos %}
[step]
input:  'a-20.txt', 'b-10.txt', extract = '{name}-{par}.txt', group_by='single'
output: expand = '{_name}-processed-{_par}.txt'
run('echo ${_output}; touch ${_output}')
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that the sigil `{}` is exclusively used for named wildcards and you should not use `${}` because it will be interpreted as strings.

### Option `skip`

Option `skip` takes either a constant (`True` or `False`) or a function. Option `skip=True`  will make SoS skip the execution of the current step. Using `skip=True` is not very useful so this option is often used with a SoS variable. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input:
	fasta_files,
	skip=len(fasta_failes) == 1

output: 'merged.fasta'

run('command to merge multiple fasta files.')

{% endhighlight %}

Here the `skip` option gets the value of `True` if there is only one input file. The command to merge multiple input files would then be skipped.

Another use of option `skip` is to assign it a function. In this case, this function will be applied
to each input group with `_input` as the first variable and all `paired_with`, `pattern`, `loop` variables (e.g. `_loopvar`) as keyword arguments. The input group will be skipped if this function returns `False`. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
def filter_group(ifiles, **kwargs):
    return all(os.path.getfile(x) > 0 for x in ifiles)

input: group_by='combinations', skip=filter_group
{% endhighlight %}

will check all input groups and skip groups with one or two empty files (file size = 0).


### `dynamic` input files

In order to determine the best execution strategy, SoS evaluates all expressions for all steps before the execution of a workflow to figure
out input and output of steps. This works most of the time but sometimes the input of a step can only be determined at runtime. For example,
if you would like your workflow to automatically scan an input directory and process all fasta files under it, or if a previous step produces
files that cannot be determined beforehand, you can specify input files as follows,

{% highlight sos %}
input: 'input/*.fasta'
{% endhighlight %}

The problem is that no file or a wrong set files might exist during the planing stage so SoS might skip this step or start the step
with a wrong set of files. To address this problem, you can declare the input files as **dynamic** by passing a `dynamic` object

{% highlight sos %}
input: dynamic('input/*.fasta')
{% endhighlight %}

This tells SoS that the input of this step can only be determined at runtime and will execute the step only after all its previous
steps have been completed.


### Summary

Options of step `input` are evaluated in the following orders:

1. A list of input files, if specified, would replace `input`, which is by default output from the previous step.
2. Option `filetype` filters input files. **The output becomes `input`**.
3. Option `group_by` groups the files into several groups, named `_input`
4. Option `for_each` repeat `_input` for each loop var, named `_loopvar` if `for_each='loopvar'`.
5. Option `paired_with` pairs one or more variables with `input`, variable `paired` is paired with `input`
    and variable `_paired` is paired with `_input` in each loop if `paired_with='paired'`
6. Option `pattern` extract variables from filenames in `input`. Variable `extracted` is paired with `input`
    and variable `_extracted` is paired with `_input` in each loop if `extract='{extracted}_other_part'`.
7. Option `skip` optionally skip all or part of the input groups.

The differences between looped and non-loop steps are sumarized in the following figure

## Step output

### Output files

Output files of a step can be specified by step `output`. Whereas step `input` override or
change SoS provided variable `input` to produce one or more variable `_input`,
the step `output` specify `output` which should be `[]` if no output is generated
(or of interest). Similar to `input`, step output accepts strings, variables, expressions, and allows wildcard characters. For example, the following are acceptable output files

{% highlight sos %}
output:  []

output:  'accepted_hits.bam'

output:  aligned_reads, bam_stats

output:  'aligned/*.bam'

output:  expand_pattern('aligned_{samples}.bam')
{% endhighlight %}

In the last example, function `expand_pattern` is used to contruct list of files from items of a sequence `samples`. In case of `input` loop, step `output` actually determines variable `_output` for each input loop. For example, the following step accepts one or more bam files and index them using command `samtools index`. The input files are passed one
by one so generate multiple `output` files (`'${_input}.bai'`). 

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input:
	bamfiles, group_by='single'

output:
	'${_input}.bai'

run('''samtools index ${_input} ''')
{% endhighlight %}

The use of variable `output` in this scenario is discouraged because `output`, as the collection of all `_output` increases with each input group. The accumulation only happens when `_output` and `output` are different so `output` will stay the same if all output files are specified as in the following example

{% highlight sos %}
output: [x + '.bai' for x in bamfiles]
{% endhighlight %}

### `dynamic` output files

Similar to the cases with [dynamic input files](#dynamically-determined-input-files-function-dynamic), the
output of some steps could also not be determined beforehand. For example, with the following script that generates `html` files that cannot be determined during dry run, 

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
run:
    rm -f *.html

[10]
input: []
output: '*.html'

import random
for i in range(5):
    run('touch result_${random.randint(1, 20)}.html')
{% endhighlight %}

SoS will determine that you do not have any output file (no `*.html` file) and produce the following output

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos
INFO: Execute default_0:
INFO: input:   []
INFO: output:  unspecified
INFO: Execute default_10:
INFO: input:   []
WARNING: *.html does not expand to any valid file.
INFO: output:  []
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, you will need to define the output as `dynamic` using

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
run:
    rm -f *.html

[10]
input: []
output: dynamic('*.html')

import random
for i in range(5):
    run('touch result_${random.randint(1, 20)}.html')
{% endhighlight %}

so that SoS knows that the output can only be determined after the completion of the step. Because of this, variable `output` is unavailable to the step process.

## Step dependencies

This item specifies files that are required for the step. Although not required, it is a good practice to list resource files and other dependency files for a particular step. For example

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input:
	fasta_files

depends:
	reference_seq

{% endhighlight %}

Similar to `output` options, dependent files can also be defined after `input` options and consist of
dependent files determined from loop variables. 

The following figure summarizes the effect of `input`
and `output` options and input options `group_by` and `for_each` on the flow
of input and output files and related variables.


![step_options]({{site.baseurl}}/media/step_options.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

## Step process

A step process is the Python statements that perform certain tasks and produce step output from step input. A step process can contain arbitrary Python statements. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
output: 'a.txt'
with open(${_output!r}, 'w') as dest:
   dest.write('some text')
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
output: 'a.txt'
run('echo "some text" > ${_output!q}')
{% endhighlight %}

use inline (interpreted and executed by SoS) python code or shell script to generate `a.txt`. 

Step processes are executed within SoS and are executed sequentially. However, part or all of the step process can be executed externally and potentially in parallel as step `task`.

## External `task`

If a job is long and time consuming, it is much preferred to submit them as separate tasks to be executed, for example, on a cluster system. These jobs should be specified using the `task` keyword, which marks the beginning of a task, with optional runtime options to control its execution. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input: group_by='single'

task: concurrent=True

run('''
samtools index {_input}
''')
{% endhighlight %}

execute a shell script in parallel (with `concurrent=True`). The step process can consists of arbitrary python statements and execute multiple step actions. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
task:
try:
   action1()
except RuntimeError:
   action2()
{% endhighlight %}

execute `action1` and `action2` if `action1` raises an error.

{% highlight sos %}
task:
for par in ['-4', '-6']:
   run('command with ${par}')
{% endhighlight %}

executes commands in a loop. This is similar to

{% highlight sos %}
pars = ['-4', '-6']
input: for_each=pars
task:
run('command with ${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

but the `for` loop version would not be able to be executed in parallel. Note that SoS actions can be used outside of `step process` but only statements specified after the `process` keyword can have runtime options and be executed in separate processes. That is to say,

{% highlight sos %}
pars = ['-4', '-6']
input: for_each=pars
run('command with ${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

is equivalent to

{% highlight sos %}
pars = ['-4', '-6']
input: for_each=pars
task:
run('command with ${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

but the latter can have additional runtime options to run commands in parallel

{% highlight sos %}
pars = ['-4', '-6']
input: for_each=pars
task: concurrent=True
run('command with ${_pars}')
{% endhighlight %}

Because step tasks are executed outside of SoS, variables assigned in step tasks are not accessible to SoS. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10: shared='res']
res = some_action()
{% endhighlight %}

executes `some_action()` in step process and return its result as a shared variable `res`. The following script,

{% highlight sos %}
[10: shared='res']
task:
res = some_action()
{% endhighlight %}

however, does not work because `res` is assigned in step task and is not accessible from the step.

### Option `workdir`

Default to current working directory.

Option `workdir` controls the working directory of the process. For example, the following step downloads a file to the `resource_dir` using command `wget`.

{% highlight sos %}
[10]

run: workdir=resource_dir

  wget a_url -O filename

{% endhighlight %}

### Option `concurrent`

Default to `False`.

If the step process is repeated for different input files or parameters (using input options `group_by` or `for_each`), the loop process can be execute in parallel, up to the maximum number of concurrent jobs specified by command line option `-j`.

### Option `env`

The `env` option allow you to modify runtime environment, similar to the `env` parameter of the `subprocess.Popen` function. For example, you can execute your command with in a specific directory using

{% highlight sos %}
task:  env={'PATH': '/path/to/mycommand' + os.sep + os.environ['PATH']}
run:
   mycommand 
{% endhighlight %}

### Option `prepend_path`

Option `prepend_path` is a shortcut to option `env` to prepend one (a string) or more (a list of strings) paths to system path. For example, the above example can be shortened to

{% highlight sos %}
task:  prepend_path='/path/to/mycommand'
run:
   mycommand 
{% endhighlight %}

### Option `walltime`
