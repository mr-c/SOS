SoS uses [Python](http://www.python.org) expressions and statements. If you are unfamiliar with Python, you can learn some basics of Python, usually in less than half a day, by reading some Python tutorials (e.g. [the official python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)). This [short introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) is good enough for you to use SoS.

The only difference between SoS' python syntax and standard Python syntax is that **string literals are format string that will be [interpolated](#string-interpolation) using SoS defined sigil**.

and introduces the following SoS-specific syntax:

* `[names: options]` line to define steps of workflows
* special directives such as `input:`
* A special script style of function calls for SoS actions
* structural preprocessors such as `%include`, `%if`, `%cell`

## String interpolation

On top of python string manipulation functions and similar to recently introduced (Python 3.6) format string, SoS uses string interpolation to replace variables and expressions within a string with their values. For example, expressions `resource_path`, `sample_names[0]` and `sample_names` would be replaced by their values in the following string definitions.

{% highlight python %}
resource_path = '~/.sos/resources'
ref_genome    = '${resource_path}/hg19/refGenome.fasta'     # '~/.sos/resources/hg19/refGenome.fasta'

sample_names  = ['A', 'B', 'C']
title         = 'Sample ${sample_names[0]} results'         # 'Sample A results'
all_names     = 'Samples ${sample_names}'                   # 'Samples A B C'
{% endhighlight %}

Depending on the return type of the expression

* String representations (`repr(obj)`) are returned for objects in simple Python types (e.g. string, True, False, None, numeric numbers)
* For objects with an iterator interface (e.g. Python `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, and `set`), SoS join the string representation of each item by a space or comma as specified by conversion flag `!,` (see [conversion and format](#conversion-and-format) for details). More specifically,

  * List of strings will be converted to a string by joining strings with a space or comma.
  * Dictionary of strings will be converted to a string by joining dictionary keys with no guarantee on the order of values.

If you are unhappy with the string conversion, you can always format your object using python expressions such as `${repr(obj)}` and `${', '.join(x for x in obj)}`.

SoS supports nested interpolation, for example

{% highlight python %}
'${_input[${index}]}'
{% endhighlight %}

would evaluate `${index}` and then `${_input[?]}` where `?` is the result of `${index}`.

Note that you can continue to use Python string functions such as

{% highlight python %}
ref_genome = resource_path + '/hg19/refGenome.fasta'
title      = 'Result for the first sample {} is invalid'.format(sample_names[0])
{% endhighlight %}

but string interpolation is recommended for multi-line scripts because it is easier to read.

SoS interpolation also support all string format and conversion specification as in the [Python string format specifier](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatspec), that is to say, you can use `: specifier` at the end of the expression to control the format of the output. For example

* `${1/3. :.2f}` in a string literal yields `0.33` instead of its long representation `0.3333333333333333`, and
* `${filename!r}` in a string literal yields `'Article by "Jane Eyre"'` (note the quotation mark) if `filename='Article by "Jane Eyre"'`.

The latter is interesting because SoS uses correct quotation marks for filenames with quotation marks, making

{% highlight python %}
R(```
read.csv(${_input!r})
```)
{% endhighlight %}

a safer choice than

{% highlight python %}
R('''
read.csv("${_input}")
''')
{% endhighlight %}

because `${_input}` might contain quotation marks.

SoS also supports a few other conversion operators, for

{% highlight python %}
file1='file 1.txt'
file2='~/SoS/test.sos'
files=['a.txt', 'b.txt']
{% endhighlight %}

| convertor | usage | input | output |
| :----------| :----- | :----- | :-------|
| `s`         | `str()`  | `${file1!s}` | `file 1.txt` |
| `r`         | `repr()`  | `${file1!r}` | `'file 1.txt'` |
| `q`         | `quoted()` | `${file1!q}` | `file\ 1.txt`|
| `e`         | `expanduser()` | `${file2!e}` | `/path/to/user/SoS/test.sos`|
| `a`         | `abspath(expanduser())` |  `${file2!a}` | `/path/to/user/SoS/test.sos` |
| `b`         | `basename())` |  `${file2!b}` | `test.sos` |
| `d`         | `dirname())` |  `${file2!d}` | `/path/to/user/SoS/` |
| `,`         | `', '.join()` | `${files!,}` | `a.txt, b.txt`|

For example, the following command

{% highlight python %}
run('cat ${_input!q}`)
{% endhighlight %}

would produce the correct command and execute

{% highlight python %}
cat 'Bon Jovi.txt'
{% endhighlight %}

instead of

{% highlight python %}
cat Bon Jovi.txt
{% endhighlight %}

for `_input=['Bon Jovi.txt']`. The conversion flags can also be combined, as shown in

{% highlight python %}
files   = ['AB.txt', 'C D.txt']
fname   = '${files!q,}'            # AB.txt,C\D.txt or AB.txt,'C D.txt'
{% endhighlight %}

If the default sigil conflicts with the script used, an alternative sigil can be used. Please see section [option `sigil`](#option-sigil) for details.


## Section header for workflow steps

SoS defines workflows that consists of multiple steps. A step is marked by a section head in the format of

{% highlight python %}
[names: options]
{% endhighlight %}

The header should start with a `[` from the beginning of a line and end with a `]`. It can contain one or more names with optional section options. 

## SoS directives

SoS introduces a number of directives to specify elements of workflows, including

* `parameter:` to define command line options
* `input:`, `output:`, `depends:` to define input, output, and dependent files of workflow steps, and 
* `task:` to define (long) tasks that will be executed as separate tasks


## Script style function

SoS allows you to write SoS `action` (basically a Python function) in a special script format. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
R('''
pdf('${input}')
plot(0, 0)
dev.off()
''', workdir='result')
{% endhighlight %}

can be written as

{% highlight sos %}
R:     workdir='result'
pdf('${_input}')
plot(0, 0)
dev.off()
{% endhighlight %}

**The script is a string without quotation marks** and the normal string interpolation will take place. You can also indent the script (add leading white spaces to all lines) and write the action as

{% highlight sos %}
R:  workdir='result'
   pdf('${_input}')
   plot(0, 0)
   dev.off()
{% endhighlight %}

The latter is much preferred because it avoids trouble if your script contains strings such as `[1]` and `option:` (and be treated as SoS directives), and more importantly, allows starting a new statement from a non-indented line. For example, `check_command('dot')` would be considered part of a R script in

{% highlight sos %}
R:  workdir='result'
pdf('${_input}')
plot(0, 0)
dev.off()

check_command('dot')
{% endhighlight %}

but a separate action in 

{% highlight sos %}
R:  workdir='result'
   pdf('${_input}')
   plot(0, 0)
   dev.off()

check_command('dot')
{% endhighlight %}

Although the script format is more concise and easier to read, it is limited to actions that accept a string as its first parameter and cannot return value or be used within `try/except` of `if/else` statements.

One final difference between SoS and regular Python 3 syntax is that SoS is more lenient on the use of mixed tab and spaces for indentation. Although it is highly recommended that you use all spaces for indentation, SoS will give an warning and treat tabs as 4 spaces during execution.
