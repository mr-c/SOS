Although arbitrary python functions can be used in SoS step process, SoS defines some **`actions`** (e.g. the `run` function in the aforementioned examples)
that can be used in a SoS script. The only difference between a SoS action and a regular Python function is that they can behave differently
in different `run_mode`. For example,

* Most SoS actions return 0 directly in `inspect` mode.
* Some SoS actions such as `check_command` work in both `run` and `inspect` mode so that you can check if you script can be executed by running it in inspect mode.

Because SoS executes all step processes in `inspect` and `prepare` mode for the planning of large workflows, **it is important to enclose data processing steps in SoS actions or execute conditionally (with `if run_mode == 'run'`)**. For example, running script

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
import time
time.sleep(5)
{% endhighlight %}

with command `sos run` will sleep for 15 seconds instead of 5 seconds because the `sleep` function will be called in inspect, prepare, and run mode. To fix this, you can either put the function in an action

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
python:
   import time
   time.sleep(5)
{% endhighlight %}

or use `run_mode` condition

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
if run_mode == 'run':
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
{% endhighlight %}

It is easy to define your own actions. All you need to do is to define a function and decorate it with a `SoS_Action` decorator. For example

{% highlight sos %}

from pysos import SoS_Action

@SoS_Action(run_mode='run')
def my_action(parameters):
    do_something_with_parameters
	return 1
{% endhighlight %}

`run_mode='run'` can also be `run_mode=('inspect', 'run')` or `run_mode='inspect'` indicating in which mode the function will be executed (instead of returning 0 directly).

## Option `run_mode`

All actions have pre-defined run_mode. For example, `sh` action runs at `run` mode and `download` runs at `prepare` mode. If for some applications you would like to run an action in different mode, you can change it by setting option `run_mode` to a mode at which an action would be executed. For example, the following step

{% highlight sos %}
[install_fastq: provides=executable('fastq')]
run: run_mode='prepare'
  script_to_install_fastq
{% endhighlight %}

would be called when an executable `fastq` is required. The commands would be running in `prepare` mode to install the program for the execution of the workflow.


## Option `docker_image`

If a docker image is specified (either a name, an Id, or a file), the action is assumed to be executed in the specified docker. The image will be automatically downloaded (pulled) or loaded (if a `.tar` or `.tar.gz` file is specified`) if it is not available locally. Note that this option only affect script executing actions such as `run`, `python` and `perl` so other actions such as `check_command` will be executed on the host machine even if it is included in the step process.

For example, executing the following script 

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
python3: docker_image='python'
  set = {'a', 'b'}
  print(set)
{% endhighlight %}

under a docker terminal (that is connected to the docker daemon) will

1. Pull docker image `python`,  which is the official docker image for Python 2 and 3.
2. Create a python script with the specified content
3. Run the docker container `python` and make the script available inside the container
4. Use the `python3` command inside the container to execute the script.

Additional `docker_run` parameters can be passed to actions when the action
is executed in a docker image. These options include

* `name`: name of the container (option `--name`)
* `tty`: if a tty is attached (default to `True`, option `-t`)
* `stdin_open`: if stdin should be open (default to `False`, option `-i`)
* `user`: username (default o `root`, option `-u`)
* `environment`: Can be a string, a list of string or dictinary of environment variables for docker (option `-e`)
* `volumes`: string or list of string, extra volumes that need to be link, in addition to SoS mounted (`/tmp`, `/Users` (if mac), `/Volumes` (if [properly configured](https://github.com/bpeng2000/SOS/wiki/SoS-Docker-guide) under mac) and script file)
* `volumes_from`: container names or Ids to get volumes from
* `working_dir`: working directory (option `-w`), default working directory, or working directory set by runtime option `workdir`.
* `port`: port opened (option `-p`)
* `extra_args`: If there is any extra arguments you would like to pass to the `docker run` process (after you check the actual command of `docker run` of SoS

## Option `docker_file`

This option allows you to import a docker from specified `docker_file`, which can be an archive file (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.bzip`, `.tar.xz`, `.txz`) or a URL to an archive file (e.g. `http://example.com/exampleimage.tgz`). SoS will use command `docker import` to import the `docker_file`. However, because SoS does not know the repository and tag names of the imported docker file, you will still need to use option `docker_image` to specify the image to use.

## Action `sos_run`

Action `sos_run(workflow, source)` executes a specified workflow. The workflow can be a single workflow, a subworkflow (e.g. `A_-10`), or a combined workflow (e.g. `A + B`). Because the workflow is executed from a step, it takes step `_input` as the input of the nested workflow and it can access local step variables. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
import random

[simulate]
output:   'result_${_reps}.txt'
run:
simulate_experiment --seed=${seed} --output=${_output}

[10]
reps = range(100)
input: for_each='reps'
outout: 'result_${_reps}.txt'

seed = random.randint(1, 2**32)
sos_run('simulate')
{% endhighlight %}

would run the nested pipeline `simulate` (which is a single step in this example) 100 times with their own `seed`, and `_reps`. 



The workflow can be defined in the current script, or in other SoS scripts, in which case the name or full path of the SoS script should be provided to parameter `source`. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[myworkflow]
sos_run('A+B', source="AB.sos")
{% endhighlight %}

defines a nested workflow with workflow `A` and/or `B` defined in `AB.sos`. The nested workflow is a combination of two workflows `A` and `B` with their own parameters sections. SoS searches the specified files in the current working directory, the directory of the master script, and a search path specified by variable `sos_path` defined in the SoS global (`~/.sos/config.yaml`) or local (`.sos/config.yaml`) configuration files, and will produce an error if no file can be found.

## Action `run`, `bash`, `sh`, `csh`, `tcsh`, `zsh`

Actions `run(script)` and `bash(script)` accepts a shell script and execute it using `bash`. `sh`, `csh`, `tcsh`, `zsh` uses respective shell to execute the provided script.

These actions, as well as all script-executing actions such as `python`, also accept an option `args` and allows you to pass additional arguments to the interpreter. For example

{% highlight sos %}
run: args='-n'
  echo "a"
{% endhighlight %}

will execute the script with command `bash -n` (check syntax).

## Action `python` and `python3`

Action `python(script)` and `python3(script)` accepts a Python script and execute it with python or python3, respectively.

Because SoS can include Python statements directly in a SoS script, it is important to note that embedded Python
statements are interpreted by SoS and the `python` and `python3` actions are execute in separate processes without
access to the SoS environment.

For example, the following SoS step execute some python statements **within** SoS with direct access to SoS variables
such as `input`, and with `result` writing directly to the SoS environment,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
for filename in input:
    with open(filename) as data:
        result = filename + '.res'
        ....
{% endhighlight %}

while

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input: group_by='single'

python:

with open(${input!r}) as data:
   result = ${input!r} + '.res'
   ...


{% endhighlight %}

composes a Python script for each input file and calls separate Python interpreters to execute them. Whereas
the Python statement in the first example will always be executed, the statements in `python` will not be executed
in `inspect` mode.

## Action `R` and `check_R_library`

Action `R(script)` exexute the passed script using `Rscript` command. Action `check_R_library` accept an R library and optionally can check for required versions. If the libraries are not available, it will try to install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), or [github](https://github.com/). Github package name should be formatted as `repo/pkg`. Action `check_R_library` is available in both `run` and `inspect` mode.

For example, `check_R_library('edgeR')` will check and install (if necessary) `edgeR` from bioconductor. `check_R_library('stephens999/ashr')` will check and install `ashr` package from a github repository https://github.com/stephens999/ashr.

`check_R_library` can also be used to check for required version of packages. For example:

{% highlight sos %}
check_R_library('edgeR', '3.12.0')
{% endhighlight %}
will result in a warning if edgeR version is not 3.12.0, and

Multiple versions is allowed, for example:
{% highlight sos %}
check_R_library('edgeR', ['3.12.0', '3.12.1'])
{% endhighlight %}
Or, simply:
{% highlight sos %}
check_R_library('edgeR', '3.12.0+')
{% endhighlight %}
It is also possible to restrict package to old version, for example:
{% highlight sos %}
check_R_library('ggplot2', '1.0.0-')
{% endhighlight %}

Note that version mismatch triggers a warning message, not an error. If you would like to enforce certain version, use

{% highlight sos %}
fail_if(check_R_library('ggplot2', '1.0.0+') != 0, 'Version 1.0.0 or newer version of ggplot2 is required')
{% endhighlight %}

The default R library repo is `http://cran.us.r-project.org`. It is possible to customize the repo, for example:

{% highlight sos %}
check_R_library('Rmosek', repos = "http://download.mosek.com/R/7")
{% endhighlight %}

## Action `perl`, `ruby`

Action `perl(script)` execute the passed script using `perl` interpreter. Action `ruby(script)` execute the passed script using `ruby` interpreter.

## Action `node`, `JavaScript`

Action `node(script)` and `JavaScript(script)` execute the passed script using `node` interpreter.

## Action `docker_build`

Build a docker image from an inline Docker file. The inline version of the action currently does not support adding any file from local machine because the docker file will be saved to a random directory. You can walk around this problem by creating a `Dockerfile` and pass it to the action through option `path`. This action accepts all parameters as specified in https://docker-py.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/#build because SoS simply pass additional parameters to the `build` function.

For example, the following step builds a docker container for [MISO](http://miso.readthedocs.org/en/fastmiso/) based on anaconda python 2.7.

{% highlight sos %}
[build_1]
# building miso from a Dockerfile
docker_build: tag='mdabioinfo/miso:latest'

	############################################################
	# Dockerfile to build MISO container images

	 tar \
	 gzip

	WORKDIR /usr/local
	RUN pip install misopy
{% endhighlight %}

## Action `download`

Action `download(URLs, dest_dir='.', dest_file=None, decompress=False)` download files from specified URLs, which can be a list of URLs, or a string with tab, space or newline separated URLs. 

* If `dest_file` is specified, only one URL is allowed and the URL can have any form.
* Otherwise all files will be downloaded to `dest_dir`. Filenames are determined from URLs so the URLs must have the last portion as the filename to save. 
* If `decompress` is True, `.zip` file, compressed or plan `tar` (e.g. `.tar.gz`) files, and `.gz` files will be decompressed to the same directory as the downloaded file.

For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
GATK_RESOURCE_DIR = '/path/to/resource'
GATK_URL = 'ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/2.8/hg19/'

download:   dest=GATK_RESOURCE_DIR
    ${GATK_URL}/1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.gz.md5
    ${GATK_URL}/1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz.md5
    ${GATK_URL}/dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.gz.md5
    ${GATK_URL}/dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.idx.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.idx.gz.md5
    ${GATK_URL}/hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.gz.md5
    ${GATK_URL}/hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz
    ${GATK_URL}/hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz.md5
{% endhighlight %}

download the specified files to `GATK_RESOURCE_DIR`. The `.md5` files will be automatically used to validate the content of the associated files. Note that 

SoS automatically save signature of downloaded and decompressed files so the files will not be re-downloaded if the action is called multiple times. You can however still still specifies input and output of the step to use step signature


{% highlight sos %}
[10]
GATK_RESOURCE_DIR = '/path/to/resource'
GATK_URL = 'ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/2.8/hg19/'
RESOUCE_FILES =  '''1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.gz
    1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.gz.md5
    1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz
    1000G_omni2.5.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz.md5
    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.gz
    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.gz.md5
    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.idx.gz
    dbsnp_138.hg19.vcf.idx.gz.md5
    hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.gz
    hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.gz.md5
    hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz
    hapmap_3.3.hg19.sites.vcf.idx.gz.md5'''.split() 
input: []
output:  [os.path.join(GATK_RESOURCE_DIR, x) for x in GATK_RESOURCE_FILES]
download(['${GATK_URL}/${x}' for x in GATK_RESOURCE_FILES], dest=GATK_RESOURCE_DIR)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the `download` action uses up to 5 processes to download files. You can change this number by adjusting system configuration `sos_download_processes`.


## Action `report`

Action `report(script, filename=None, mode='a')` writes the specified script to the report channel, or to a file with specified `filename`. It will by default append to the report (`mode='a'`) but you can start a new report with `mode='w'`.


Note that:

* Although markdown is generally used, SoS does not restrict the type of report a script generates. If so desired, you can use this mechanism to generate a log file in plain text format, a HTML file with fancy style, any flavor of markdown that you can post-process, or a `.Rmd` file that can be loaded into RMarkdown.

* The report is generated from the steps that are executed so the content can be controlled with parameters and configuration files. 


## Action `pandoc`

Action `pandoc` converts the report generated so far to another format. Parameters `outputfile`, `format`, `to`, `filter` and `extra_args` can be used to customize the output. Please refer to [pandoc and pypandoc documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/) for details about these parameters.
 

## Action `check_command`

Action `check_command(cmd, pattern)` check existence of command or the output of the command. This action works in both dyrun and run mode so it can be used to check the existence of command in inspect mode.

For example, if a script contains step

{% highlight sos %}
[100]
check_command('tophat')
run('tophat ...')
{% endhighlight %}

Command 'sos run script -i' would check the existence of command `tophat` without actually running
the `tophat ...` command.

Action `check_command(cmd, pattern)` execute specified `cmd` and searches specified pattern in its output. `pattern`  should be one or a list of python regular expressions (see [Python re module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html), especially the `search` function for details). It raises an exception if the output does not match any of the patterns. This function is usually used to check the version of commands.

For example, action

{% highlight sos %}
check_command('STAR --version', ['2.4.0', '2.5.0'])
{% endhighlight %}
checks the output of command `STAR --version` and raises an error if it does not contain string `2.4.0` or `2.5.0`.

Note that

1. `check_command` will return a non-zero value if the command exist but returns non-zero value (e.g. because of incorrect command line argument). A warning message will also be printed.

2. `check_command` will timeout after 2 seconds because it is intended to check basic information of specified command. The action will produce a warning message and return 1 in this case.

## Action `fail_if`

Action `fail_if(expr, msg='')` raises an exception with `msg` (and terminate the execution of the workflow if the exception is not caught) if `expr` returns True.

## Action `warn_if`

Action `warn_if(expr, msg)` yields a warning message `msg` if `expr` is evaluate to be true.

## Action `abort_if`

Action `abort_if(expr, msg='')` stops the execution of the current step (or current processes if within `for_each` loop) and gives a warning message if `msg` is specified. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
[10]
input: '*.txt', for_each=1

abort_if(os.path.getsize(_input[0]) > 10000)
do_something_else
{% endhighlight %}

skips files that are larger than `10k`.

## Utility functions and `logger`

SoS exposes a few utility functions that can be helpful from time to time. 

## Function `get_output`

Function `get_output(cmd)` returns the output of command (decoded in `UTF-8`), which is a shortcut for `subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True).decode()`. It is worth noting that SoS kills any function call after 5 seconds in inspect mode so you will need to put this function call inside a step process if it will take more than 5 seconds to execute.

## Function `expand_pattern`

Function `expand_pattern` expands a string to multiple ones using items of variables quoted between `{ }`. For example,

{% highlight sos %}
output: expand_pattern('{a}_{b}.txt')
{% endhighlight %}

is equivalent to

{% highlight sos %}
output: ['{x}_{y}.txt' for x,y in zip(a, b)]
{% endhighlight %}

if `a` and `b` are sequences of the same length.

## SoS `logger` object

The SoS logger object is a `logging` object used by SoS to produce various outputs. You can use this object
to output error, warning, info, debug, and trace messages to terminal. For example, 

{% highlight sos %}
[0]
logger.info('I am at ${step_name}')
{% endhighlight %}

would print a logging message `I am at default_0` when the first step is execute.

{% highlight sos %}
$ sos run test.sos
INFO: Execute default_0: 
INFO: input:   []
INFO: I am at default_0
INFO: output:  unspecified
{% endhighlight %}
