    "SoS uses [Python](http://www.python.org) expressions and statements. If you are unfamiliar with Python, you can learn some basics of Python, usually in less than half a day, by reading some Python tutorials (e.g. [the official python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)). This [short introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) is good enough for you to get started.\n",

    "* A flexible string interpolation syntax to interpolate expressions in string literals using SoS defined sigil.\n",
    "* `[names: options]` line to define steps of workflows\n",
    "* special directives such as `input:` to specify input, output, and dependency targets of steps\n",
    "* A special script style of function calls for SoS actions\n",

    "check_command('dot')\n",
    "```\n",

    "Although the script format is more concise and easier to read, it is limited to actions that accept a string as its first parameter and cannot return value or be used within `try/except` of `if/else` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final difference between SoS and regular Python 3 syntax is that SoS is more lenient on the use of mixed tab and spaces for indentation. Although it is highly recommended that you use all spaces for indentation, SoS will give an warning and treat tabs as 4 spaces during execution."
