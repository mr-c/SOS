    "## Step options\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step options** are specified after step name that assists the specification of workflows. SoS provides the following options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option `skip`\n",
    "\n",
    "Option `skip` takes two formats, the first format has no value\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[10: skip]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and is equivalent to\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[10: skip=True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole step will be skipped as if it is not defined at all in the script. This option provides a quick method to disable a step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second format takes a value, which is usually an expression that will be evaluated when the step is executed. For example, in the following workflow,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# tool suite to align the reads\n",
    "parameter: quality_check = True\n",
    "\n",
    "[10: skip= not quality_check]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 10 will be skipped if option `--quality_check no` is specified from command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option `sigil`\n",
    "\n",
    "Option `sigil` accepts a string for an alternative sigil, or `None` to disable string interpolation in the step. The sigil must be two strings separated by a space, such as `%( )`, `< >`, and `#{ }`. Sigils with equal left and right symbol such as `# #` can be used although they do not support features such as nested interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option `shared`\n",
    "\n",
    "SoS executes each step in a separate process and by default does not return any result to the master SoS process. Option `shared` is used to share variables between steps. This option accepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A string (variable name), or\n",
    "* A map between variable names and expressions (strings) that will be evaluated upon the completion of the step.\n",
    "* A sequence of strings (variables) or maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of a step, local variables defined in the `shared` option will be sent to the global environment so that later steps can use the updated value. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parameter: trim = False\n",
    "parameter: input_files = list\n",
    "\n",
    "[10: shared={'input_files':'output'}, skip=trim is False]\n",
    "input:  input_files, group_by=1\n",
    "output: '${_input[0]}.trimmed'\n",
    "\n",
    "sh:\n",
    "    trim ${input} > ${output}\n",
    "\n",
    "[20]\n",
    "input: input_files\n",
    "# do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `trim` is an option to trim input files defined in another parameter `input_files`. If `trim` is false, step 10 is ignored and step 20 handles `input_files`. If `trim` is True, the files are trimmed and produces `${_input[0]}.trimmed`. Variable `input_files` are sent back to the global environment so that step 20 would be handling the trimmed version of input files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A map syntax is recommended to share `output` of one step with others, because the variable assignment will be evaluated only after the step is complete:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1: shared = {'test_output': 'output'}]\n",
    "...\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "input: test_output\n",
    "```\n",
    "The map syntax is evaluated as expressions; therefore it is possible to finer control what specific output, or variations of output, to share with others. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1: shared={'test_output_1':'output[0]', 'test_output_2': 'output[1]'}]\n",
    "...\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "input: test_output_1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to shared the first file in `output` (filename `output[0]`) instead of the entire output file list.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Because global variables are readonly, they cannot be changed by individual steps through the `shared` option. Shared variable therefore has to be either new variables or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option `provides`\n",
    "\n",
    "This option lists files or targets a step generates so that it can be called if the target is required but does not exist. Please see section [auxiliary step](Format-Specification#auxiliary-workflow-steps-and-makefile-style-dependency-rules) for details. A step can be treated as both a forward step and an auxiliary step despite of the differences on how they are invoked.\n"
