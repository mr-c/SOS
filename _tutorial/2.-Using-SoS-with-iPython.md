Using sos magic within iPython allows you to run sos within an iPython session. It does not provide a full-blown SoS system but on the other hand you can use all the iPython features that you are familiar with.

## Setting up ipython

sos magic is installed by default when you install sos. A profile has been created for you so that you can use it by command

```python
ipython --profile sos 
```

You can also load the extension using command `%load_ext sos_magic` after ipython starts in its default profile, or edit `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` and add `sos_magic` to `c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions` so that the extension is loaded automatically to your default profile. The latter is useful if you would like to use the ipython mode in Jupyter notebook (```jupyter notebook``` and select python as your kernel).

## SoS ipython magics

### Magic `sosdict`

Let us starts with the basic. When you start an `ipython` interactive shell through `ipython` command or [ipython/Jupyter notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html), you are given a cell that you can enter python expression or statements, or iPython magic. There are two kinds of magics

* **Line magic** that starts with `%` or starts at the beginning of line without `%` if `automagic` is set to `True` (default). Line magic takes the words after it as parameter.
* **Cell magic** that starts with `%%` that takes both the words and lines after the magic word.

If the `sos_magic` extension is loaded, it already has a SoS dictionary. You can get the dictionary using line magic `%sosdict`, for example

```python
In [1]: sosdict
Out[1]: {}
``` 

The dictionary is empty because we have not assigned anything to it. Let us run a sos statement

```python
In [2]: sos a = 1

In [3]: sosdict
Out[3]: {'a': 1}
```
and you can see the sos dictionary contains one item. There are other usages of the `%sosdict` magic, you can get the dictionary by assigning the dictionary to a variable

```python
In [4]: d = %sosdict

In [5]: d.keys()
Out[5]: dict_keys(['a'])
```

If you are interested in only a subset of variables, you can list them after `%sosdict`

```python
In [6]: d = %sosdict a

In [7]: d.keys()
Out[7]: dict_keys(['a'])
```

You can get the keys of the dictionary easier using

```python
In [8]: %sosdict --keys
Out[8]: {'a'}
```

If after a while you would like to reset the dictionary and run a SoS script from fresh, you can reset the dictionary using option `--reset`

```python
In [9]: sosdict --reset

In [10]: sosdict
Out[10]: {}
```

The SoS dictionary actually contains other items such as all the SoS actions and functions. If you would like to see all of them, use option `--all`. For example,

```python
In [11]: sosdict --keys --all
Out[11]: dict_keys(['fail_if', 'expand_pattern', 'SoS_Script', 'zsh', 'download', 'perl', '__builtins__', 'R', 'logger', 'ruby', 'docker_commit', 'Rmarkdown', 'python3', 'report', 'env_variable', 'stop_if', 'SoS_Action', 'sos_variable', 'tcsh', 'warn_if', 'dynamic', 'executable', '__interactive__', 'check_R_library', 'JavaScript', 'run', 'sos_handle_parameter_', 'get_output', 'node', 'docker_build', 'interpolate', 'python', 'sos_run', 'csh', 'bash', 'pandoc', 'sos_namespace_', 'execute_script', 'check_command', 'sh'])
```

In summary, the `%sosdict` magic accepts

```python
%sosdict [-a|-all] [-k|--keys] [-r|--reset] [var1] [var2] ...
```

where

* `var1`, `var2` etc are name of variables. All variables will be displayed if no variable is specified.
* `-a|-all`: list all dictionary keys, including SoS functions and variables.
* `-k|--keys`: list only keys, not their values
* `-r|--reset`: reset the dictionary to its original content (with only SoS internal values)

### Magic `sos`

Magic `sos` can be either a line magic or cell magic. Using `sos` as a line magic, it simply executes the SoS (python) expression or statement in SoS. For example,


```python
In [5]: sos a=10

In [6]: sos 'a + 100 = ${a+100}'
Out[6]: 'a + 100 = 110'

In [7]: sos b=['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']

In [8]: sos '${b!r,}'
Out[8]: "'file1.txt','file2.txt'"
```

If you would like to execute multi-line SoS statements or scripts, you will need to use the magic in cell mode (with `%%` prefix), for example,

```python
In [9]: %%sos
run:
    echo "something"
   ....: 
something
```
runs a shell script within iPython. Similarly, you can run arbitrary shell, R, perl, python code in ipython/SoS, with string interpolation. Note that ipython already has a magic called [`%%script`](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html) that allows you to execute scripts in a cell. The difference here is that SoS process passed script with string interpolation before executing it.

You can also input one or more SoS steps and run the workflow

```python
In [10]: %%sos
   ...: resource   = '~/resources'
   ...: ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'
   ...: parameter: rep=5
   ...: 

```

Here a SoS script with a parameter section is executed, but without parameter. The `%%sos` cell magic allows you to pass command line arguments after `%%sos`, for example,

```python
In [11]: %%sos --rep 3
resource   = '~/resources'
ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'
parameter: rep=5
   ...: 

In [12]: sos rep
Out[12]: 3
```

### Magic `sospaste`

You will soon notice a problem with the cell magic `%%sos` in that it does not accept blank new lines, which is problematic for large piece of code. In this case, you can use line magic `%sospaste` to read the content directly from clipboard. Using the same example, you can select the text (with newline), and run

```python
In [5]: sospaste --rep 4
resource   = '~/resources'
ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'

parameter: rep = 5
## -- End pasted text --
```

This is the most convenient way to execute pieces of SoS script in iPython and is used most frequently.

### Magics `sosget` and `sosput`

Magics `sosget` and `sosput` are used to exchange variables between ipython and sos. For example, if you defined a variable in SoS and would like to use it in ipython, you can use magic `%sosget var1 var2` to copy the value of `var1` and `var2` from SoS dictionary to ipython namespace. Similarly, `%sosput` copies variables from the ipython namespace to SoS dictionary. For example,

```python
In [1]: %sos a = 20

In [2]: %sos b = 'a**2 = ${a**2}'

In [3]: %sosget a b

In [4]: a
Out[4]: 20

In [5]: b
Out[5]: 'a**2 = 400'

In [6]: b = 'something else'

In [7]: %sosput b

In [8]: %sosdict
Out[8]: {'a': 20, 'b': 'something else'}
```

### Magic `sosset`

If you are tired of entering certain SoS options after magic `%%sos` or `%sospaste`, you can set these options persistently using magic `sosset`. For example, if you set

```python
sosset -v 3
```

SoS will be running in a more verbose mode and print more messages. Other acceptable parameters include

* `-c CONFIG`: read from configuration file
* `-f`: force execution, regardless of signature
* `-F`: construct signature from existing files

## A complete example

Suppose you are working on a script

```python
resource   = '~/resources'
ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'

parameter: rep = 5

[1]
print(rep)
seq = range(rep)
input:  for_each='seq'

python:
  import time
  print('sleep {} seconds.'.format(_seq))
  time.sleep(_seq)
```

To check the global definition, you can copy and paste the definitions to ipython as

```python
In [1]: %%sos
   ...: resource   = '~/resources'
   ...: ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'
   ...: 

```

The statements are executed and you can check the result using

```python
In [2]: sos ref_genome
Out[2]: '~/resources/hg19'
```

Now we select the global definitions and execute them

```python
In [3]: sospaste
resource   = '~/resources'
ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'

parameter: rep = 5
## -- End pasted text --

In [4]: sos rep
Out[4]: 5
```

We can see the default parameter is passed. If you want, you can set the parameter to 10,

```python
In [5]: sospaste --rep 10
resource   = '~/resources'
ref_genome = '${resource}/hg19'

parameter: rep = 5
## -- End pasted text --

In [6]: sos rep
Out[6]: 10
```

Now, let us continue, select the next step, run `sospaste` and ....  a big block of errors! 

```python
In [7]: sospaste 

[1]
print(rep)
seq = range(rep)
input:  for_each='seq'

python:
  import time
  print('sleep {} seconds.'.format(_seq))
  time.sleep(_seq)
## -- End pasted text --
INFO: Execute default_1: 
10
INFO: input:   []
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/ys/gnzk0qbx5wbdgm531v82xxljv5yqy8/T/tmpm5g6f7k7.py", line 2, in <module>
    print('sleep {} seconds.'.format(_seq))
NameError: name '_seq' is not defined

# IGNORED

RuntimeError: Failed to execute process
"python(r'''import time
print('sleep {} seconds.'.format(_seq))
time.sleep(_seq)
''')
"
Failed to execute script. The script is saved to .sos/default_1.py. Please use command "python .sos/default_1.py" under /Users/bpeng1/SOS to test it.
```

Here 10 is printed so `rep` is valid. This means the `rep` we set last time is available and correct, then what might be the problem? Let us see what is saved in `.sos/default_1.py` using a bit magic of ipython

```python
In [8]: cat .sos/default_1.py
import time
print('sleep {} seconds.'.format(_seq))
time.sleep(_seq)
```

The error seems to be obvious, we need to use `${_rep}` for the value to be passed through string interpolation. Let us make some changes to the script, selct and run `sospaste` again:

```python
In [10]: sospaste

[1]
print(rep)
seq = range(rep)
input:  for_each='seq'

python:
  import time
  print('sleep ${_seq} seconds.')
  time.sleep(${_seq})
## -- End pasted text --
INFO: Execute default_1: 
10
INFO: input:   []
sleep 0 seconds.
sleep 1 seconds.
sleep 2 seconds.
sleep 3 seconds.
sleep 4 seconds.
sleep 5 seconds.
sleep 6 seconds.
sleep 7 seconds.
sleep 8 seconds.
sleep 9 seconds.
```

Using this method, you can execute your SoS script step by step and make sure everything works, before you execute it from a command line.
