## Using SoS with spyder

[spyder|https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) is a Python GUI that works well with ipython, and therefore SoS if you configure it properly. Spyder should be readily available if you use Anaconda python, or you can install spyder according to instructions on the [spyder website](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/).

Disclaimer: Spyder does not support third-party kernels and does not yet support `.sos` files. The SoS installer tries to patch Spyder so that it can recognize `.sos` files and the `%cell` syntax. These are supposed to change after Spyder provides native support for SoS in its next major release.

Therefore two ways to use spyder with SoS:

1. Connect spyder to an existing qtconsole with sos kernel

    * Start a qtconsole with sos kernel using command `jupyter qtconsole --kernel sos`
    * Record connection file id from command line, or by running `%connect_info` from the console if you cannot find it.
    * Start `spyder`, select `consoles` -> `Connect an existing kernel`. Put connection id and connect.

   It is certainly possible to set up a remote Jupyter server and connect to a remote SoS kernel but this usage is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

2. Make sos your default kernel by adding 

    ```
    c.IPKernelApp.kernel_class =  'pysos.kernel.SoS_Kernel'
    ```
    to `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` . You can then start `spyder` and use spyder as usual.
