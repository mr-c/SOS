## Reporting features of Script of Scripts

SoS provides a simple yet powerful reporting mechanism. That is to say,

* Any lines that start with `'! '` are report lines that will be written to a default report file. A space after `!` is required for better formatting, but lines with a single `!` is also acceptable.
* Action `report` can be used to append text to this report, or optionally to another report file.

Similar to other texts in a SoS script, reports will be interpolated before they are written to the output. For example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env sos-runner
#fileformat=SOS1.0

! == My report
! Date: Apr. 2016

# human
# align raw reads to human genome
[parameters]
# path to STAR
star_path = '~/bin/STAR'

[*_1]
output:   'figure.png'
R:
   R script

! == some analysis
! ![result](${output})
```

will generate a text file

```python
== My report
Date: Apr. 2016
== some analysis
![result](figure.png)
```

after the execution of the pipeline. Action report can also write to this report and provides more flexible and powerful ways of reporting different types of results. Action pandoc can be used to convert the report to various formats. Note that

* Although markdown is generally used, SoS does not restrict the type of report a script generates. If so desired, you can use this mechanism to generate a log file in plain text format, a HTML file with fancy style, any flavor of markdown that you can post-process, or a .Rmd file that can be loaded into RMarkdown.

* The report is generated from the steps that are executed so the content can be controlled with parameters and configuration files.

## Action `report`

Action `report` can be used write a block of text 

```python
report:
    == My report
    Date: Apr. 2016
```

or content of a (dynamically generated) file to the report.

```python
report(filename='report_source.txt')
```

Alternatively, it can write to another file so that multiple reports could be generated from a SoS run.

```python
report(output='alternative.txt')
```
